# open-docviewer-tabs
Chrome extension that opens Quercus DocViewer modules in new tabs.

<sub>Note: This is an unofficial extension that is still a WIP, and as such I would personally suggest disabling the extension on quizzes in case of potential errors.

# Installation
1. Download the ZIP and unzip the folder
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode in the top right corner
4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button in the top left
5. Select the `open-docviewer-tabs-master` folder
6. Enable the `Open DocViewer Tabs` extension

Currently, this extension only works on Quercus modules by clicking the extension icon.
